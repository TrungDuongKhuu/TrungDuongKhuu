Below is a **faithful, professional English translation** of your content.
I keep the structure, meaning, and tone academic–portfolio oriented (not marketing, not “AI-sounding”).

# Khuu Trung Duong

Final-year **Computer Science** student at **Ton Duc Thang University**.
I use GitHub as a place to consolidate my academic journey, personal products, and projects developed throughout four years of study, with a particular focus on two main areas:

* **Data & AI**
* **Game Development (Unity / Unreal Engine)**

## 1. Academic Overview

Throughout the Computer Science program, I have completed all major knowledge domains, including:

* Mathematics for Computer Science: calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics.
* Programming: C/C++, object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, functional programming.
* Operating systems, computer networks, embedded systems.
* Databases, system analysis and design, web development, information systems.
* Security: introduction to information security, service quality and safety management, computer security.

## 3. GitHub Organization Strategy

To make my GitHub easy to navigate for recruiters, instructors, and peers, repositories will be organized into the following main groups:

1. **Algorithms & Programming**

   * `data-structures-and-algorithms`
   * Several OOP-based mini projects.

2. **Data & AI**

   * `eda-visualization-project`
   * `machine-learning-basics`
   * `data-mining-project`
   * `nlp-basic-models`
   * `big-data-processing` (if sufficient material is available).

3. **Game Development**

   * `unity-portfolio-projects`
   * `unreal-shooter-demo`.

4. **Systems & Networking**

   * `operating-system-labs`
   * `computer-networking-labs`.

5. **DevOps / Cloud (conceptual understanding)**

   * `minicloud-docker-compose` or similar, documenting insights gained from the MiniCloud group project.

Each repository will include:

* A **clear README** describing objectives, technologies used, how to run demos, and lessons learned.
* A **clean directory structure**, separating `src/`, `notebooks/`, `docs/`, and `assets` when appropriate.
* **Executable demos or screenshots/videos**, especially for game projects.

## 4. Contact

If you would like to discuss Data, AI, or Game Development projects in more detail, feel free to contact me:

* Email: **[duongkhuu2002@gmail.com](mailto:duongkhuu2002@gmail.com)**

I will continue updating this GitHub as I refine my projects and complete additional academic and personal work.

If you want next, I can:

* **Condense this into a recruiter-friendly “short version”** for your GitHub profile, or
* Help you **extract only the 3 core projects** and rewrite this as a focused intern portfolio.
