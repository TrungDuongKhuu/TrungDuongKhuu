# Khuu Trung Duong

*(Khưu Trùng Dương)*

Final-year **Computer Science** student at **Ton Duc Thang University**.

This GitHub is maintained as a **technical academic portfolio**, reflecting my learning trajectory and practical work throughout the Computer Science program.
Repositories are created only when there are **clear outcomes, implementations, or demonstrable results**.

My current primary focus areas are:

* **Data & Artificial Intelligence**
* **Game Development (Unity / Unreal Engine)**

## 1. Purpose of This GitHub

This GitHub aims to:

* Present my **technical foundation** in a structured and transparent manner.
* Store **course-related and personal projects** with concrete results.
* Organize repositories clearly by **learning direction and application domain**, rather than creating empty or purely theoretical repositories.
